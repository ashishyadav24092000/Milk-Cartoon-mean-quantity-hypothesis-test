Our task is to determine with 30% significance level that whether- the mean filling quantity of milk in cartoon is 500 ml or Not. And based on this result we have to decide that whether the filling process of milk in cartoons should continue operating or to be stopped and corrected.


##  * Here we will use three methods of hypothesis testing to test our assumed hypothesis about mean filling time of milk in cartoon.

##  * At last we  will cross check and show to our audience that all insights or outcomes are same using these methods.
